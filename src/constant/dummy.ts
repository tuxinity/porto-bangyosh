  bio: "Hi, I’m a dreamer who happens to be a Front-End Engineer with over 3 years of experience turning ideas into beautiful, functional digital experiences. I find joy in crafting responsive websites and applications using tools like Next.js, React.js, and React Native, bringing designs to life with the elegance of Chakra-UI and Tailwind CSS. I love the magic of creating something out of nothing—whether it’s designing a seamless interface, setting up servers, or automating workflows with Docker and GitHub CI/CD. For me, coding isn’t just work; it’s a way to build dreams and connect people in meaningful ways. Let’s create something extraordinary together! .",
